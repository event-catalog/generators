# EventCatalog AWS Glue Registry - Basic Example

This example shows you how to pull and sync schemas from AWS Glue Registry into EventCatalog (without domains or services, just a direct map.)

This gives you the ability to add semantic meaning to your schemas, assign them to services and domains.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- AWS Glue Registry
- EventCatalog license key

## Setup

1. Clone this example
1. Run `npm install`
1. Get a EventCatalog license key from [EventCatalog](https://eventcatalog.cloud) (14 day free trial)
1. Run the `scripts/create-test-registry.sh` script to create a test registry with a few schemas
    - This will create a test registry called `eventcatalog-test-registry` in the `us-east-1` region
    - It will also create a few schemas in the registry
1. Run the `npm run generate` command to generate EventCatalog from the registry
    - In the `eventcatalog.config.js` file we have configured to pull all schemas from the registry into EventCatalog.
1. After the generation has finished, Run the catalog `npm run dev`
1. View your catalog at http://localhost:3000
