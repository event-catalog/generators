# EventCatalog GitHub Plugin Example: Assign Schemas to Producers and Consumers

This example shows you how to pull and sync schemas from a GitHub schema registry (example used here: https://github.com/event-catalog/flowmart-schema-registry) and assign them to producers and consumers (services) in EventCatalog.

In this example we will pull schemas from GitHub and assign them to the orders and inventory services.

Any documentation we add to our messages and services are persisted between builds, so we can keep our documentation up to date. The schemas are synced with GitHub.
