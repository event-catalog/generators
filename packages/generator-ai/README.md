# Core Features

- üó£Ô∏è Use natural language to ask questions about your EventCatalog
- ‚≠ê Choose your embedding model
- üìö Reduce the time it takes to learn and understand your architecture
- ‚≠ê And much more...

# How it works

[EventCatalog](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/) is technology agnostic, meaning it can integrate with any schemas, specs or brokers.

EventCatalog supports [generators](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/docs/development/plugins/generators).
Generators are scripts are run to pre build to generate content in your catalog. Generators can use the [EventCatalog SDK](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/docs/sdk).

With this EventCatalog plugin embeddings are generated based on your EventCatalog. You can either use huggingface or openai to generate the embeddings.

These embeddings are stored and use by EventCatalog, all locally in your project and on your computer. Once you generate the embeddings with this generator, and configure your EventCatalog project, you can use the Chat to ask questions about your catalog.

EventCatalog integrates with [OpenAI Models](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/docs/development/guides/eventcatlaog-chat/using-openai-models) or you can use our [browser based models](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/docs/development/guides/eventcatlaog-chat/using-browser-models).

These models will use the embeddings which are generated by this generator.

You can pick which model and embedding provider you want to use, and EventCatalog will download the model for you enabling you to use the Chat.

```js
...
generators: [
    [
      '@eventcatalog/generator-ai',
      {
        // This will split the markdown files into smaller chunks, this is optional and defaults to false
        // This uses MarkdownTextSplitter under the hood
        splitMarkdownFiles: false,


        // Set this to true if you want to include users and teams in the embeddings for your AI Assistant
        // This can bloat the embeddings and may effect the results you get back, false by default
        includeUsersAndTeams: false,

        embedding: {
          // defaults to huggingface
          provider: 'openai' | 'huggingface',
          //  pick your model (optional, defaults to text-embedding-3-large for openai and all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for huggingface)
          model: 'text-embedding-3-large' | 'Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2',
        },

        // optional similarity results to use, defaults to 30
        similarityResults: 40,

        // optional max tokens to use, defaults to 4096, map to your model
        maxTokens: 4096,

      },
    ]
  ],
...
```

In this example we install and setup the generator. This will parse all our catalogs files and create a new folder called `/generated-ai` with the following files:

- `documents.json` - Contains the processed documents and their metadata for the LLM model in EventCatalog
- `embeddings.json` - Contains vector embeddings for the documents. These are used by EventCatalog to do vector searches.
- `README.md` - This file just tells you that these files are generated, and not to edit them

# Getting started

## Installation and configuration

_Make sure you are on the latest version of EventCatalog_.

1. Install the package

```sh
@eventcatalog/generator-ai
```

2. Configure your `eventcatalog.config.js` file [(see example)](https://github.com/event-catalog/eventcatalog-ai-example/blob/main/eventcatalog.config.js)

3. Run the generate command

```sh
npm run generate
```

4. Configure your EventCatalog project, turn on the chat feature.

```js
{
    chat: {
        enabled: true,
    }
}
```

5. Start your project and go to `/chat` to see the AI Assistant or use the link on the sidebar.

```sh
npm run dev
```
